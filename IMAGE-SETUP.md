## How to Add Images

1. Save your logo image (the one you showed me) as `logo.png` in the `/public` folder
2. Create or use a white version and save as `logo-white.png`
3. Add the other required images with the exact filenames listed above
4. Restart the development server

## Temporary Placeholders

If you don't have all images ready yet, the website will still run but will show broken image icons. You can:
- Use stock photos temporarily from sites like Unsplash or Pexels
- Create simple placeholder images
- Add images gradually as they become available

## Image Optimization Tips

- Use JPG for photos (smaller file size)
- Use PNG for logos (better for graphics)
- Recommended max file size: 500KB per image
- Keep aspect ratios consistent for instructor photos
